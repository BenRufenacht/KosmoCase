# KosmoCase
A case designed for kosmo format synthesizer modules. The case was designed in Fusion 360 with parameters that can be easily edited to change the size of the case. It was desinged to be cut from 12 mm or 1/2 in plywood using a CNC router.

I also included stl files used to 3D print spacers to mount a power supply board and power distribution board by AI Synthesis.
